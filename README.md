# Obsidian AI Agent

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b251604-cf52-4f38-8c9d-fba67e280b64

Bring AI agents directly into your Obsidian vault. This plugin integrates AI agent CLIs (currently Claude Code) seamlessly with Obsidian - allowing you to chat with AI, edit files, and manage your knowledge base without leaving your workspace.

## Why?

Working with AI shouldn't break your flow or lose context about your vault. 

This plugin aims to keep Claude context-aware of your Obsidian environment while letting you stay in your workspace instead of switching to terminal. It also has some magics ðŸª„  to help you manage context more effectively.

See the [roadmap](#roadmap) for upcoming features I'm looking to incorporate.

## Features

- **Direct AI integration**: Chat with Claude Code directly in Obsidian's interface
- **File-first approach**: AI agents can read, edit, and create files in your vault
- **Context-aware**: Automatically includes relevant vault context in conversations
- **Real-time collaboration**: See AI edits happen live in your Obsidian interface
- **"Bash is all you need" + "files over apps" = <3**: Claude's "bash is all you need" philosophy aligns perfectly with Obsidian's "files over apps" approach â€” no proprietary formats or magics, just direct file editing

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** - Required for plugin execution
- **Claude Code CLI** - Get it from [Anthropic's Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code)

### Setup

*Coming soon to the Obsidian community plugin store*

1. **Verify CLI access**: Ensure you can run `claude` in your terminal
2. **Download**: Get the latest release (`obsidian-ai-agent.zip`) from the [releases page](../../releases)
3. **Install**: Extract from the `obsidian-ai-agent.zip` and place the folder in `[your_vault]/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-ai-agent`
4. **Enable**: Activate the plugin in Obsidian's Community Plugins settings
5. **Start chatting**: Use the AI Agent panel in your workspace right-sidebar

> [!WARNING]
> **Preview version notice**
> 
> This plugin is in active development and will modify files in your vault. It currently uses elevated permissions (`--permission-mode bypassPermissions` and `dangerously-skip-permissions`) for full functionality. 
> 
> **Recommended**: Back up your vault before use. Fine-grained permission controls are planned for future releases.

## Troubleshooting

### CLI issues
**Can't find Node.js or Claude CLI?**

1. **Verify installations**: Run `node --version` and `claude --version` in your terminal
2. **Manual configuration**: If auto-detection fails, set paths manually in **Settings > Community Plugins > Obsidian AI Agent**

**Find executable paths:**
```bash
# Node.js location
which node

# Claude CLI location
echo "$(sed -n 's/^exec "\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p' $(which claude))"
```

**Windows users**: Claude must be installed in WSL. Windows support is still being tested.

### Debug mode
**Enable detailed logging:**
1. Go to **Settings > Community Plugins > Obsidian AI Agent**
2. Enable "Debugging" to see detailed logs
3. Open Developer Console: `Cmd+Opt+I` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux)
